Welcome to pyJack by Matthew Brookes

This is a game of Blackjack made in Python. There are two versions, a command line one as well as a graphical one. 

The latter requires pygame to function and you will not get far without it.
Pygame is available for download at http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml
Python is available for download at http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/

This game is designed for Python 2.7 and Pygame 1.9

Source code is available at https://github.com/mbrookes1304/pyJack
Feel free to edit the code as it's all open source.
If you find any bugs please report them to me through my email mbrookes1304@gmail.com or submit a pull request on GitHub.

How to use

There is no need to install anything other than prerequisites Python and Pygame. 
If you will only be running the command line version there is no need for Pygame.

The graphical version will not work if any files are moved. 
It is best to move the folder as a whole instead of the individual files to prevent issues.

The two versions are called cmd_blackjack.py and gui_blackjack.py.
The former works on the python command line and the latter is a graphical version.
